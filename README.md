# Fold Flat Chair

A flat folding chair which is easy to store


In preporation for MakerFaire I realized we needed some chairs to sit in, but rather than bring some I decided to cut some out when we get there. This design is copied from something I saw in numerous places on the internet. They cut quickly (~1hr) because of the common cut lines, and they fold compleetly flat.

This is version one of the chair, I am going to update the file based on my experance with it.
